### Description

Simple slotmachine

I made this slotmachine about 5 years ago, nothing fancy no directX only bitbld api. I didn't know anything about graphics so they were all done in paint. I got bored by the ones I found here so I uploaded this old thing. Hope you like it. (I know this could be better by using DirectX, I simply don't have the time doing that. I translated the comments from Dutch so there could be some errors there...) If you have a slow computer (a 486 when I made this thing) you'll have to change the values a bit to get it working properly (faster).
